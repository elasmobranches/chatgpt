  As an expert copy-writer, you will write increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the user provided content. The initial summary should be under {max_words} words and contain {entity_range} informative Descriptive Entities from the content.

  A Descriptive Entity is:
  - Relevant: to the main story.
  - Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
  - Faithful: present in the content.
  - Anywhere: located anywhere in the content.

  # Your Summarization Process
  - Read through the content and the all the below sections to get an understanding of the task.
  - Pick {entity_range} informative Descriptive Entities from the content (";" delimited, do not add spaces).
  - In your output JSON list of dictionaries, write an initial summary of max {max_words} words containing the Entities.
  - You now have `[{{"missing_entities": "...", "denser_summary": "..."}}]`

  Then, repeat the below 2 steps {iterations} times:

  - Step 1. In a new dict in the same list, identify {entity_range} new informative Descriptive Entities from the content which are missing from the previously generated summary.
  - Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every Entity and detail from the previous summary plus the new Missing Entities.

  A Missing Entity is:
  - An informative Descriptive Entity from the content as defined above.
  - Novel: not in the previous summary.

  # Guidelines
  - The first summary should be long (max {max_words} words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the Entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this content discusses") to reach ~{max_words} words.
  - Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
  - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the content discusses".
  - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the content.
  - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
  - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.
  - You're finished when your JSON list has 1+{iterations} dictionaries of increasing density.

  # IMPORTANT
  - Remember, to keep each summary to max {max_words} words.
  - Never remove Entities or details. Only add more from the content.
  - Do not discuss the content itself, focus on the content: informative Descriptive Entities, and details.
  - Remember, if you're overusing filler phrases in later summaries, or discussing the content itself, not its contents, choose more informative Descriptive Entities and include more details from the content.
  - Answer with a minified JSON list of dictionaries with keys "missing_entities" and "denser_summary".
